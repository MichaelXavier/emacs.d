Ensure that packages have been downloaded once and init them as needed.

This will not update the sources by using `apt-get install' or
`git pull', but it will ensure that:

* the packages have been installed
* load-path is set so their elisp files can be found
* Info-directory-list is set so their info files can be found
* Autoloads have been prepared and evaluated for each package
* Any post-installation setup (e.g. `(require 'feature)') happens

When SYNC is nil (the default), all installations run
concurrently, in the background.

When SYNC is 'sync, each package will be installed synchronously,
and any error will stop it all.

Please note that the `el-get-init' part of `el-get' is always
done synchronously. There's `byte-compile' support though, and
the packages you use are welcome to use `autoload' too.

PACKAGES is expected to be a list of packages you want to install
or init.  When PACKAGES is omited (the default), the list of
already installed packages is considered.
